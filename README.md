# Unified Makers - Search, Find, Connect 🎭
Planning your wedding, party, or event shouldn’t feel like a full-time job. With Unified Makers, you can search all the skilled vendors you need, find the ones that best fit your vision, and connect with them easily. No more endless scrolling through blogs or asking for recommendations—everything you need is right here, in one place.

From photographers and florists to caterers and more, we make it ridiculously easy to discover the experts you need, so you can cruise through the planning, knowing you’ve got the best vendors at your fingertips.

## The Inspiration Behind Unified Makers 💡
The idea came from my own experience. In 2024, my fiancée and I were planning our wedding in Perth, Australia. We spent hours scrolling through blogs claiming to list the “top 10” vendors, only to find confusing and inconsistent information. If you’ve ever planned a wedding or event, you’ve probably faced the same frustration.

Unified Makers solves this by:
- **Simplifying the Search**: Quickly find reliable vendors by category, location, and more.
- **Empowering Professionals**: Skilled vendors get a modern platform to showcase their expertise and grow their reach.
- **Starting Locally**: Launching in major Australian cities to build a strong foundation before expanding further.

## Development Journey 🚀
Unified Makers is being developed in phases to deliver an intuitive and powerful platform:
1. **Find Professionals**: Users can easily search for and filter vendors. *(Current Phase)*
2. **Professional Profiles**: Vendors can sign up and create personalised profiles to showcase their services.
3. **Seamless Interactions**: Account-based features will enable smooth communication and booking between users and professionals.

Let’s make event planning simple, stress-free, and even a little fun!
