# Unified Makers

Finding the right professional for your wedding, party, or event shouldn’t be a hassle. Unified Makers is your one-stop platform to discover and connect with skilled vendors in your city. Whether you need photographers, florists, caterers, or other event professionals, we make it easy to find the experts you need—all in one place.

## The Inspiration Behind Unified Makers
The idea came from personal experience: planning a wedding with my fiancée. We spent hours scrolling through blogs claiming to list the “top 10” vendors, only to find scattered, inconsistent information. Sound familiar?

Unified Makers solves this by:
- **Simplifying the Search**: Quickly find reliable vendors by category, location, and more.
- **Empowering Professionals**: Skilled vendors get a modern platform to showcase their expertise and grow their reach.
- **Starting Locally**: Launching in major Australian cities to build a strong foundation before expanding further.
